NBody
-----

A small plugin trying to add some interesting stuff about changing orbit during time-warp.
____

NBody (Limited)
  Vessel will be affected by all celestial bodies all the time, not just the body that it's currently orbiting.
  
AtmosphereDecay
  Inactive vessels will be affected by atmosphere and gradually lower its Ap when getting into atmosphere, and finally will re-entry and crash to the surface.
  
WarpableEngine
  Mainly for ion thrusters (and any other really low thrust ones), useful when TWR is very low.
